# Smart Traffic Light System
# DO NOT use max(), sorted(), or any built-in sorting methods.
# Use ONLY if-elif-else statements for all logic.

# Use this Input structure

    "South": {"density": "High", "emergency": False},
    "East": {"density": "High", "emergency": True},

#Create function to change density to numeric values


#Create function to decide with traffic direction goes first and create priority list incase there is more than 1 direction has an emergency


# Call the function
